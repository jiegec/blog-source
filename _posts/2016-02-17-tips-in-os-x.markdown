I'm sure many people have already known this. But i haven't memorize it yet.

How to screen capture:

    Shift+Command+3: Capture fullscreen.
    Shift+Command+4: Capture region.
                   : Press space to capture window. 
                   : Hold option and drag, then
                   : you will capture a region with its center in where you started dragging 
                   : and one of its corners under your cursor.
    Ctrl+OneOfTheTwoAbove: Capture to clipboard.
    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location: Change the default location storing the images.
