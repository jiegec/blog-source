My term starts tomorrow. Sad. Homework haven't finished. I went to Guangzhou for GDKOI thie weekend, and i haven't known the result. It should be bad. I have no confidence at all. I may write less when this term starts. The second term of Senior 2 should a hard time for me. That's all. Sorry for the laziness.
