When I was on my way to dinner, a phone call came. It said my grand grandma was dying. She was born in Xuantong 2nd, which is 1910 in Gregorian calendar. She is 106 years old now. She has lived really long. She experienced so many historical events that seemed far to us. Everyone seems like calm, and is preparing for the destined death. This will be the second death I have encountered. Don't know to say what. Speechless.

Update: RIP. Rest In Peace.
