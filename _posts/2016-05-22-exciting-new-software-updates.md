Just got a piece of great news: GHC 8.0.1 is out! See the announcement [here][http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.ghc.devel/11928].

So excited! And Emacs 25 release will be out soon. Using Emacs 25.0.94 now. Many new features available. See [this][http://puntoblogspot.blogspot.com/2016/05/emacs-251-news.html] for more information.

Recently I have finally started to use mu4e and gnus. What makes it truly great is that they integrate org, bbdb and so on.
