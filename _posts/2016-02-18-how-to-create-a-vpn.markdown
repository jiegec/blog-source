Today i'm going to introduce how to create a vpn.

First of all you need a VPS somewhere with a static ip. Then, choose CentOS 7 and use the script from [here](https://github.com/travislee8964/L2TP-VPN-installation-script-for-CentOS-7). And that's all. You can add more users in /etc/ppp/chap-secrets.

Enjoy your safe browsing in a free Wi-Fi! Do not forget to direct all traffic to VPN.
